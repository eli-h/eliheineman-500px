# eliheineman-500px

A basic test app, where you can view some of the popular photos on 500px. Has infinite scroll, and photo details!

## Installation

This app uses Cocoa Pods to load images asynchronously.  I have uploaded them with the project so it should work without any action on your part.  But in case there is a problem you can install them by running the command...

```bash
pod install
```

## Usage
Open the .xcworkspace, not the .xcodeproj to properly use the app.
