# eliheineman-500px

A basic test app, where you can view some of the popular photos on 500px. Has infinite scroll, and photo details!

## Installation

This app uses Cocoa Pods to load images asynchronously, so you will need to install them.  To do so run the command...

```bash
pod install
```

## Usage
Open the .xcworkspace, not the .xcodeproj to properly use the app.
